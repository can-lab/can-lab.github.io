<p>In this multi-session study, you will be trained to regulate your own brain
activity by means of Neurofeedback. During Neurofeedback, activity in brain
networks of which you are usually not aware, is recorded and shown to you in
real-time. This immediate feedback will make you aware of this brain
activity and allows you learn to control it.</p>
<p>Once you have learned how to control your brain networks, we are interested
in how this novel skill affects cognition and affect, and we will ask you to
perform several tasks inside and outside of the MRI scanner, while we take
a variety of physiological measures (heart rate, respiration, skin
conductance). There will be 6-7 MRI sessions and 2 behavioural sessions, of
varying lengths.</p>
<p>We are further interested in how being able to regulate these brain networks
affects your mood and physiology in daily life, and we will ask you to answer
short daily questionnaires and wear a wristband that records physiological data
(hear rate, skin conductance, physical activity) for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Your participation in the study will be spread over 7 weeks in which you will
visit the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging 8-9 times in total.</p>
<p><strong>You will be reimbursed 190–200 € for your participation!</strong></p>
