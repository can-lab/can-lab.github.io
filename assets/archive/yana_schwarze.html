<p>I am very interested in understanding the mechanisms of stress and its effects on mental health, with the hope that this research this will be clinically relevant in the future.</p>
<p>For my internship I’m working on the DynaMORE project with Sophie Bögemann. DynaMORE is a multidisciplinary project, which aims to improve mental health and well-being and to provide resilience in the face of adversity. This is done by collecting psychological, behavioural, neural, and physiological markers in at risk-individuals during stressful life phases.</p>
<p>I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Cognitive Science in Osnabrück, Germany and I am now in the second year of my master in Cognitive Neuroscience in Nijmegen. Next to my studies I work as a research assistant for the healthy brain study where I am involved in the acquisition of MRI data.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to try out new foods and practice different sports like squash or bouldering. </p>
