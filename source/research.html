<h2 id="1">Reallocation of neural resources during acute stress</h2>
<p>One key assumption in our work is that acute stress prompts a strategic alteration in the way our brain functions. When faced with imminent threat, organisms mount a concerted response to restore homeostasis that involves central release of neurotransmitters and peripheral stress hormones. These act as neuromodulators to alter cellular properties of large-scale neuronal populations and thus exert widespread yet regionally specific effects in the brain. We have demonstrated such regionally specific effects in the amygdala, the hippocampus, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the reward system. Furthermore, we make use of recent developments in functional neuroimaging that allow for identification and quantification of connectivity among large-scale networks. Such methods have revealed a finite set of distributed networks that can be identified based on both consistent activation in model-based studies and coherent signal fluctuations in the resting brain. This set includes networks that have been associated with executive control and vigilance or salience processing. We investigate how acute stress alters the balance between such large-scale networks and what mechanisms underlie this network reorganization.</p>

<h2 id="2">Time dependency of effects of stress on cognition</h2>
<p>Effects of stress on cognition are mediated by stress-sensitive neurotransmitters and hormones, such as catecholamines and corticosteroids, which act in specific temporal domains. An important question is therefore whether the actions of stress-sensitive neuromodulatory systems within these different temporal domains are also functionally different. In a series of studies, we and our colleagues have shown that the slower actions of corticosteroids often oppose the arousing and anxiogenic actions of rapid catecholaminergic activation. This work has contributed to the now widely held view that an important function of corticosteroid release is to normalize brain activity in the aftermath of stressful experiences.</p>

<h2 id="3">Neuroendocrine regulation of memory formation</h2>
<p>Stressful, aversive events are extremely well remembered. Such a declarative memory enhancement is evidently beneficial for survival, but the same mechanism may become maladaptive and culminate in mental diseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress hormones are known to enhance postlearning consolidation of aversive memories but are also thought to have immediate effects on attentional, sensory, and mnemonic processes during memory encoding. Despite their significance for our understanding of the etiology of stress-related mental disorders, effects of acute stress at memory formation, and their brain correlates at the system scale, remain poorly understood. In a series of functional neuroimaging studies, we have investigated the neural correlates of memory formation following controlled experimental induction of acute stress. This work has revealed how amygdala and hippocampal function is altered during acute stress, and provides insight into the important question how memories for stressful events are qualitatively different.</p>

<h2 id="4">Neural interactions underlying memory consolidation</h2>
<p>Ongoing fluctuations within large-scale networks have been shown to persist in “offline” periods following activity. These findings imply that stress-sensitive pathways may similarly “reverberate” after a stressful event. We indeed found prolonged activation following acute stress within the “salience processing” network. Such persistent fluctuations are of particular interest in the context of memory consolidation. It is increasingly acknowledged that after initial formation, memories undergo various stages of consolidation that transform memories into neocortical representations. Such offline processes occurring over the course of consolidation have remained elusive until electrophysiological research in rodents demonstrated that task-related neuronal spiking patterns are spontaneously “replayed” during post-learning periods, and that hippocampal theta oscillations may drive binding, reactivation, and strengthening of connections between distributed neocortical representations. We have developed new methods to track spontaneous reactivations of memory representations in humans. This work has demonstrated the importance of such processes for long-term memory formation and has thereby opened new avenues for targeted interventions.</p>

<h2 id="5">Gonadal hormone action on affective circuits</h2>
<p>Gonadal steroid hormones such as testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, play an important role in the regulation of affective states. For instance, mood disorders are more common among women and symptoms appear to intensify in periods of hormonal instability such as the premenstrual phase. Such effects are thought to be caused by fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone levels that interact with stress-sensitive hormones and neuromodulators. Testosterone, on the other hand, appears to mainly affect motivational systems. Higher testosterone is associated with enhanced reward sensitivity, social dominance, and proneness to aggression. Such effects are often difficult to observe directly in behavior: an increased tendency to respond aggressively, for instance, may be overridden by prefrontal cortex-dependent control mechanisms. For this reason, we use functional neuroimaging to more directly investigate effects of these gonadal hormones on the neural circuitry underlying affect and affective regulation. This work has provided new insights into how testosterone and progesterone regulate affective circuits in humans.</p>
