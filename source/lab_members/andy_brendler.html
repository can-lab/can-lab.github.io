<p>My main research interest lies in the area of affective processing, which is something that drives us on a daily basis. I am intrigued about the question how the mechanisms involved can deviate on a behavioral and neural level and may manifest themselves in stress-related and affective disorders such as PTSD, anxiety disorders or depression.</p>
<p>I joined the CAN lab for my CNS master project in which I currently work on an effort-based decision-making task under the supervision of dr. Eliana Vassena. We aim to apply computational phenotyping of motivation for affective disorders.</p>
<p>Before joining the CAN lab, I completed an internship at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in the context of a different Psychology Master program, where I worked on a project concerning the development of PTSD. This internship showed me once more that the intersection between affective neuroscience and clinical psychology is what interests me the most.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy pretty much every sport where a ball is involved â€“ so if you are up for it, come and challenge me.</p>
