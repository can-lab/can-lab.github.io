<p> Currently I am a research assistant, aiding in the study of Savi Huan Wang that investigates the effects of endocannabinoid system deficits induced by early-life stress on fear memory extinction. My main research interests are stress-related disorders, especially depression and PTSD, learning and memory. </p>
<p> My bachelor’s degree is in Biomedical Sciences, which included an internship with a study done by Martin Mobius and Leonore Bovy, studying the effects of combining rTMS and ABM training in dysphoric students as a model for depression. Afterwards I did the Cognitive Neuroscience Master and had an internship with the study I am still assisting now. Furthermore, I had the chance to join Linda de Voogd, Floris Klumpers and Daphne Everaerds to Lowlands for an observational study of real-life stress induced by a stage performance. </p>
<p> In my time off, I like to meet with friends and walk with my dog. Furthermore, I alternate between multiple hobbies like playing piano, painting, mainly aquarelle, and practicing different forms of martial arts.</p>
