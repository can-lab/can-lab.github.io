<p>I am currently an intern on the project of Savi Huan Wang investigating the effects of endocannabinoid system deficits induced by early-life stress on fear memory extinction. Apart from that I am still exploring my research interests but behavioural, medical and psychotherapeutic neuroscience spark my interest.</p>
<p>I have my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Medical Biology. This Includes an internship performing a systematic review regarding the effects of propofol on the developing brain under supervision of Carlijn Hooijmans at the SYRCLE department of the RadboudUMC. I am currently doing the Neurobiology specialization of the Medical Biology master following courses next to my current internship.</p>
<p>In my free time I like to go to festivals with friends, collect vinyl records, cook food from all over the world, play board games and watch old detective movies.</p>
