<p>Hi! My name is Lybrich, I’m 24 years old, and I’m a first-year master’s student in Neurobiology at Radboud University. In January I joined the CAN-lab to do my first research internship, where I am working on the Trauma & Control study under supervision of Florian Krause. My bachelor’s degree was in psychology (majoring in cognitive neuropsychology), and though I switched to neurobiology, my interest in psychiatric disorders has always remained. Therefore I’m very excited that I can combine my interest in neurobiology and psychology in this project, where we explore the potential of rt-fMRI neurofeedback for managing PTSD symptoms. </p>

<p> In my free time I love to sing, play the guitar, read and write, and I also direct a student theatre group. Next to this, I am a member of Slow (the student tennis association), and I see my friends and family as much as I can!</p>
