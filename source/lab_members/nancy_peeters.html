<p>My main research interest lies in clinical studies, particularly targeting treatments for patients with anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. For my doctoral research, conducted in affiliation with Pro Persona Research and Radboud University - BSI, I am exploring schema therapy as a potential treatment for anxiety patients who have shown resistance to conventional therapies.</p>

 

<p>I will join the CAN lab as a research coordinator for the “Cortisol voor PTSS’ (CovoS) project, funded by ZonMW. This project involves a translational study combining a pharmacological intervention and neuroimaging techniques in individuals diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Together with Erno Hermans, Benno Roozendaal, Gert-Jan Hendriks and Robbert-Jan Verkes, our goal is to investigate the interplay between early life adversity, epigenetic processes, and cortisol release via the stress response system, known as the HPA axis. Additionally, we aim to test the hypothesis that administering glucocorticoids could potentially facilitate fear extinction. This investigation holds promise for advancing personalized treatment approaches for PTSD through the integration of pharmacological enhancements into psychotherapeutic interventions. </p>

 

<p>Before starting my PhD, I earned my bachelor's degree in Psychology and completed my master's degree in cognitive neuroscience, both at Radboud University.</p>
