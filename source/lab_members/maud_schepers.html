<p>My fascination for the human brain started during Highschool already. I was mainly intrigued by the great capacities of such a ‘small’ and interestingly looking organ. That’s why I decided to learn more about the brain and move from my hometown Utrecht to Maastricht to start my Bachelor in Psychology and Neuroscience. I am currently enrolled in the second year of my Master (RM Cognitive Neuroscience). Since I was very curious what doing research at the Donders Institute was like, I started looking for internships here. </p>
<p>I am not really sure if there is any topic yet that is of particular interest to me, however, Neurofeedback and BCI are definitely on top of my list. This fits my main interest in the capacities of the brain; to me, it’s amazing that we are able to train our brains and that we can use brain activity to, for example, control machinery such as a robot arm. Therefore, a professor at my university in Maastricht suggested me to get in touch with Dr. Florian Krause. I have joined Florian on his ‘stress-resilience’ study, where we focus on NF training of large-scale brain networks. My internship will end in July 2021, so I will be around for some time. I am looking forward to it! </p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy riding my racing bike, taking photographs and cooking. I also enjoy drinking beers with friends every now and then. </p>
