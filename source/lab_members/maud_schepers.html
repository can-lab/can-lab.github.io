<p>My fascination for the human brain started during Highschool already. I was mainly intrigued by the great capacities of such a ‘small’ and interestingly looking organ. That’s why I decided to study Psychology and Neuroscience at the Univeristy of Maastricht. After the completion of my Bachelors, I studied Cognitive Neuroscience in Maastricht too. I joined the lab as part of my graduation internship and for the purpose of my thesis I worked on the Brain Network Regulation neurofeedback study. This study aims to find out whether people are able to regulate their brain activity, and if so, how this affects neuroscience.</p> 
<p>I currently work as a Research Assistant, and I'm involved in different projects. The main ones are BraNeReg (Brain Network Regulation) and TraumaCtrl (Trauma Control) with Dr. Florian Krause. I am not really sure if there is any topic yet that is of particular interest to me, however, Neurofeedback and BCI are definitely on top of my list.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy riding my racing bike, hiking, photography and cooking.</p>
