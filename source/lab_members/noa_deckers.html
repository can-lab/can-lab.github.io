<p>My main research interest is how stress can affect cognitive and affective functions and how this relates to physiological processes.</p>  
<p>I have always been interested in the field of neuroscience and psychopathology. My interest in stress and memory started when I followed the minor ‘neuroscience of stress-related psychopathology’ in the Donders Institute. I participated in this minor during my bachelor Biomedical Sciences in Nijmegen. That is how I enrolled in this half-year internship. I am supervised by Laura de Nooij and together with Lana Miedema we will work on the CovoS (Cortisol voor PTSS) project. The aim of this study is to research the relationship between epigenetic mechanisms, early life adversity and cortisol in participants with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Moreover, the effect of glucocorticoid administration before fear extinction will be studied. There will also be a preparatory study with healthy participants to investigate the underlying neural processes of fear extinction and recall. During my internship I will mostly work on this preparatory study by testing and analysing
physiological and fMRI data during the fear paradigm of the participants.</p> 
<p>During my spare time I practice various sports, such as cycling, running and fitness. A fun fact about me is that donkeys are my favourite animal. Luckily for me, they stand just a mile walking from my house.</p>
