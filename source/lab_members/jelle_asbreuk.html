<p>Some of my research interests are mental health, stress and neurological disorders.</p>
<p>I am currently an intern working on the DynaMORE project with Judith van Leeuwen and Sophie Bögemann. DynaMORE aims to promote stress resilience and improve mental health and well-being in the face of adversity. This is done by collecting psychological, behavioural, neural, and physiological markers in at risk-individuals during stressful life phases.</p> 
<p>I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Medical Biology here in Nijmegen. In 2020 I started with the master Medical Biology and I am currently doing the Neurobiology specialization.</p> 
<p>In my free time I like to play squash, go to festivals, watch Netflix series  and drink beers with friends.</p>
