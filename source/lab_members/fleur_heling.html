<p>Hi! My name is Fleur Heling, and I am a second-year master’s student in Cognitive Neuroscience at Radboud University. I previously completed a bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences at Utrecht University, where I developed a strong interest in the brain, particularly its role in stress and (mal)adaptation. During my bachelor’s, I wrote my thesis on the effect of neuropeptide Y on the locus coeruleus as a possible mechanism for stress modulation, which further sparked my enthusiasm for neuroscience.</p>
 

<p>This year, I am excited to join the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience (CAN) group for my internship, where I am working on the DESTRESS (Stress and Resilience in the Workplace) project under the supervision of Sophie Bögemann. DESTRESS is a large-scale, multi-site cohort study that aims to enhance workplace resilience by identifying key resilience factors and developing an ethical, user-friendly tool for early stress detection, enabling timely dialogue between employees, employers, and occupational health professionals. Within this broader project, I am involved in the deep phenotyping study at the Donders Institute, where a subset of participants takes part in neuroimaging and biological assessments. These data complement the larger cohort dataset collected across project sites, which includes self-report questionnaires, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), Ecological Physiological Assessment (EPA), and organisational/workplace-level data to study stress and resilience in daily life.</p>
 

<p>In addition to my internship, I am writing my master’s thesis using data from the DynaMORE (Dynamic Modelling of Resilience) project. This project focuses on identifying psychological and neurobiological processes that support resilience in students, using a similar multi-method approach that combines lab-based measures such as neuroimaging and biological sampling with real-life data from EMA and EPA.</p>
 

<p>Outside of academia, I enjoy travelling, going on little outings, running, reading, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
