<p>My main research interests are interdisciplinary with a particular interest in translational research within the field of biological psychiatry. I would like my research to have implications for psychiatry or mental health, and would like to contribute to the development of personalised treatment and more accurate predictions on the level of the individual. </p>
<p>My main research interests include the effects of stress (hormones) on memory, stress resillience and (mal)adaptation of the brain. As a research assistant, I'm working on the DynaMORE study and the 'Cortisol voor PTSS' (CovoS) project. DynaMORE aims to develop an advanced mathematical in silico model of stress resillience by monitoring healthy at-risk individuals during stressful life phases, serving for prevention of stress-related disorders. In the CovoS study, we investigate the potential of glucocorticoid administration to improve fear extinction, in particular in participants affected by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with dysregulation in the stress response system, aiming to improve and personalise PTSD treatment in the future.</p>
<p>During my bachelor's in Biomedical Sciences at the Radboud University, I did my research internship at the Roozendaal lab investigating the effects of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation on the strength and generalisation of extinction memory in rats. I'm beyond excited to expand my knowlegde and skills even further during this new challenge as research assistant. In addition to my activities at the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab, I'll persue my master's degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Radboud University starting from February 2024.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to go for a long walk with my dog Teddy, be around my horses or play games with family and friends. I also love to travel, cook and listen to music!</p>
