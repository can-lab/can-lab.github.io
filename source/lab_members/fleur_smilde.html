<p>I am grateful to be a PhD student in the CAN lab since September 2025. My main research interest is stress resilience. During my PhD I will work on the DESTRESS project (destress-project.nl). I am eager to study what different factors contribute to better mental health outcomes for individuals, by combining fMRI with daily life stress-related measures.</p>

<p>Prior to joining the CAN-lab, as part of my Cognitive Neuroscience MSc program, I was part of a psychopharmacology project using an SSRI manipulation aiming to get a more comprehensive understanding of the role of serotonin; A neurotransmitter implicated in various mental health disorders. </p>

<p>In my free time I also keep busy: I knit, read, run, and train with a acrobatics/circus group in Nijmegen :)</p>
