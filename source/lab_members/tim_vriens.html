<p>I am a research assistant in the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab. Currently, I am working on different projects in the lab. My research interests are in the fields of stress, decision-making, motivation, computational modelling, learning and memory.  Previously, I completed a Master’s program in Cognitive Neuroscience, where I studied the effects of stress on effort based decision-making. Before that, I completed a Bachelor’s program in Mathematics and Biomedical Sciences, where I did an EEG-fMRI combined study to the role of the prefrontal cortex in prediction and prediction error. Furthermore, I did research on methods for clustering recordings of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to practice all kinds of sports, especially fencing. </p>
