<p>Hi! I am Maie and in the context of my final year in the cognitive neuroscience master's program of the Donders institute, I am doing an internship at the CANLab. Under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Wirz, I am currently involved in the TRuSt project. Using functional neuroimaging we aim to investigate the effects of cognitive reappraisal training, and acute stress, on emotion regulation. I also get to help out in a pharmacological study looking into the roles of stress hormones in the temporal dynamics of memory representations (ORA projects). </p>
<p>The research topics which captivate me the most are at the intersections of cognitive neuroscience and stress-related psychopathology. Having a background in the field of psychology, I hope to conduct research that both gives insights into neural mechanisms of disease and also aids the development of evidence-based treatment options. That’s why I am very excited to be a part of the CANLab! </p>
<p>In my free time, I can usually be found catching up with friends, a good book, or unwinding in nature. I also love trying my hand at DIY arts & crafts projects even when arguably lacking some talent. </p>
