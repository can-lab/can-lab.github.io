<p>I work on an ERC funded project (ERC-CoG-682591/STRESNET) investigating large-scale brain network dynamics and their links to stress reactivity in daily life. I do this through multi-modal research methods in which I investigate brain activity under stress using fMRI, and link it to stress reactivity in daily life using Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA). Using these methods, I attempt to reconcile stress research in the lab with stress research in daily life. Part of this project involves continuing the line of research to investigate how these systems are altered not only in a healthy population, but also in people with stress related disorders such as burnout.</p>
<p>I am originally from Lebanon and previously worked as a research assistant in the Radiology department at the American University of Beirut Medical Center prior to joining the CAN-Lab. There, my work mainly involved developmental neuroimaging, looking at structural development in childhood, as well structural development in patient populations with autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>My future goal in research is to investigate the developmental aspects of stress sensitivity, combining my previous and current research experience into one question: What is the developmental impact of early life adversity on large-scale brain networks and the biological stress system, and how is this relevant to future psychopathology?</p>
<p>On a personal note, anyone who has met me has probably heard my lecture on Trello. I very much enjoy organizational tasks, and spend my free time coming up with new ways to do things in Trello.</p>
