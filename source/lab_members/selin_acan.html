<p>I am a software engineer from Cyprus who recently joined to CAN-Lab under the supervision of Erno Hermans, Martin Dresler, Mitra Baratchi and Peter De Loof. Before joining to CAN-Lab, I obtained my master's degree in University of Amsterdam in Software Engineering and my thesis was about prediction of the long-term outcome of pre-natal patients with asphyxia. This practical opportunity showed me that I would like to continue my career as a researcher in this interdisciplinary field combining software engineering with medical sciences. I always had a huge interest in neuroscience, how the human brain works and processes information and the cognitive functions like as perception, memory, decision-making, language, and more which plays an important part in all of our lives. As many researchers would agree discovering how the brain processes information and generates thoughts and emotions is a challenging and intellectually rewarding endeavor. Currently, I found the chance to join a project called the 'Wearanize'Project in CAN-Lab. The goal of the project is to use the data collected by the wearable devices and provide machine learning models to support users with their daily activities.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to do a lot of sports and reading!</p>
