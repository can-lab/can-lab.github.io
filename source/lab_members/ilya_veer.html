<p>I studied clinical neuropsychology and cognitive psychology at the University of Amsterdam. I received my PhD from Leiden University, where I studied the effects of stress on brain function and connectivity and its relation to stress-related disorders (https://bit.ly/3jtEC4t). The past eight years I have been working as postdoc and senior scientist at Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>Currently, I am co-PI on the H2020-funded DynaMORE project (https://dynamore-project.eu), in which I oversee the longitudinal multicenter studies. I also co-chair the ENIGMA task-based fMRI working group (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-tbfmri), which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). In this working group we aim to do meta-analysis of task-based activation in relation to genetics, pooling ~10,000 data sets from labs around the world.</p>
<p>Over the past years, I have been the project manager for ENIGMA HALFpipe, a nipype-based containerized pipeline to do functional MRI (task and rest) analysis from raw data to group stats (https://github.com/HALFpipe/HALFpipe). With HALFpipe, we promote harmonization and reproducibility of functional MRI analyses.</p>
<p>In a former life I was a marionet player at the Amsterdam Marionette Theater (https://www.marionettentheater.nl), which I nowadays support as member of the advisory board. Despite recent setbacks, I am still a fanatic AFC Ajax fan!</p>
