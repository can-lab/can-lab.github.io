<p>My main research interests are in translational study about early-life stress (ELS) and stress adaptation. I want to investigate whether the different pharmacological interventions have diverging effects on stress adaptation depending on ELS-status in healthy population and further in PTSD patients.</p>
<p>Therefore, I study in Erno J. Hermans’ lab (Can-lab) now. The first project I work on is about: The interactive effects of ELS and acute stress on functioning of brain circuits involved in emotional regulation. The second project I am working on now is about: The effects of endocannabinoid system deficits induced by early-life stress on fear memory extinction. This is a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, pharmacological fMRI study which mainly investigates the diverging effects of Hydrocortisone and THC on fear memory extinction and amygdala/hippocampus functioning in the group with and without severe ELS. It would develop an experimental model of exposure therapy for PTSD patients with and without ELS, thus to introduce a more personalized treatment to improve the outcome of exposure therapy for them.</p>
<p>Before joining the CAN-lab, I got Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at TianJin Commercial University and Master’s degree in Psychology at South China Normal University. My Master thesis was about: The white matter trait of unconscious patients.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, doing sports, cooking, handcrafts making.</p>
