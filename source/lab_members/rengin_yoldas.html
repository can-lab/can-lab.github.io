<p>I am a CNS Master student and currently do my internship in the CAN-lab where I am part of the BraNeReg project under the supervision of Florian Krause. Using (real-time) fMRI Neurofeedback Training, we try to increase the stress resilience in participants and analyse how this training might influence cognition and affect.</p> 
<p>In general, my research interests are focusing more and more on the neuroscience behind stress-psychpathologies, but also other neurological disorders like neurodegenerative disorders. I am interested in learning how to investigate the detailed functioning of disorders, but also in which way neuroscience can help in expanding therapies and interventions. </p>
<p>Before I started the CNS Master's programme here at the Radboud University, I finished my Bachelors at the University in Osnabrueck, Germany in Cognitive Science. After I finished my internship for my Bachelor Thesis in one of the labs of the Radboudumc, I was happy to come back here to do my Masters. </p> 
<p>In my free time, I really enjoy to just wind down a bit and do Yoga, Painting and have nice evenings with friends. </p>
