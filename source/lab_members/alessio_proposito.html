<p>I am very interested in how affective processes modulate cognitive and memory functions in the brain. In the future, I would like to investigate neural mechanisms with a multidisciplinary approach, which allows to study the interactions between the different levels of brain organization.</p>
<p>During my internship at the CANlab, I am going to work with Lisa Wirz on her project which focuses on the temporal dynamics of memory representations by means of functional neuroimaging and physiological measures of arousal.</p>
<p>I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Psychological Science and Techniques at the University of Bologna, while I received the Masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation at the Sapienza University of Rome. However, my research experience is principally built around the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Unit (SCAN-Unit) at the University of Vienna. Since 2017, I have worked on three different studies in which I was mainly involved in the analysis of behavioural, physiological and fMRI data.</p>
<p>I love exploring nature and playing chess. I have no pets but four little sisters should be enough!</p>
