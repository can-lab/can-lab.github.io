<p>I am very interested in how affective processes modulate cognitive and memory functions in the brain. During my PhD, I would like to investigate neural mechanisms with a multidisciplinary approach, which allows me to investigate how the different levels of brain organization dynamically interact.</p>
<p>After one year of internship at the CANLab and some time working as a Research Assistant with Dr. Lisa Wirz, I have now moved on to my own PhD project.</p>
<p>I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Psychological Science and Techniques at the University of Bologna, while I received my Masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychological Rehabilitation at the Sapienza University of Rome. However, my research experience is principally built around the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Unit (SCAN-Unit) at the University of Vienna. Since 2017, I have worked on three different studies in which I was mainly involved in the analysis of fMRI data.</p>
<p>I love exploring nature, listening to music and playing chess. I have no pets but four little sisters should be enough!</p>
