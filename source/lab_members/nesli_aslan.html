<p>I am in my second year of the CNS master’s program at Radboud University. Before this, I’ve completed my bachelor’s degree in psychology at Sabancı University in Istanbul, Turkey.</p> 
<p>I am mainly interested in researches investigating the underlying mechanisms of stress related disorders, their neural markers and how emotion regulation trainings contribute to them.</p> 
<p>Currently I am doing my internship at CAN lab under the supervision of Sophie Bögemann and I am part of the DynaMINT project, an interventional study which belongs to the DynaMORE (Dynamic modelling of resilience) consortium. DynaMINT is a longitudinal study aiming to improve the stress resilience and mental health of at risk individuals by offering them either positive reappraisal or reward sensitivity interventions in stressful moments. The focus of my thesis is to investigate which baseline characteristics predict better outcome of the reward sensitivity training to reduce daily life stress, particularly by comparing the differences in baseline striatal activity among individuals.</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy doing yoga, listening to music, singing and sometimes bouldering.</p>
