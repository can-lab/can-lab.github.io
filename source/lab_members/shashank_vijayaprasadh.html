<p>My main research interests lie around Motivation, Cognitive control and stress on one side, I would also want to learn and work more with neurological (movement) disorders such as Alzheimer's, Epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease. </p>
<p>As a first step towards this, I have joined as an intern in the DANDY project where we try to dissociate the roles of Dopamine and Noradrenaline during a stress response using ‘several tasks’ (Can’t say what they are Ssssshh) which can be later useful in creating methods of interventions for PTSD, Depression and many other stress related disorders. </p>
<p>I did my bachelor’s in Biomedical Engineering back in India and maybe in the future I would wanna try and combine my knowledge from that with Neuroscience to make devices for rehabilitation of patients with Neurological disorders. </p>
<p>I love to do bouldering, squash, play video games and make dad jokes :) </p>
