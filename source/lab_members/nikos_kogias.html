<p> During my studies I discovered my fascination about the workings of the brain and how one can eventually link neural function to human behaviour. I am particularly interested in mechanisms of stress at the neural level and the way it affects cognition. </p>

<p> I am currently working on a clinical trial investigating stress reduction in university students, as part of my PhD, supervised by Dr. Florian Krause, Dr. Dirk Geurts, Prof. Dr. Anne Speckens, and Dr. Erno Hermans. The aim of this study is to find out whether Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction is effective in reducing stress in students. More importantly, we aim to better understand how and for whom it works, to enable better prevention and treatment of stress-related complaints in students in the future.</p>

<p> I grew up in Greece, where I finished my Bachelor’s studies in Pharmacy at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. After a 4-month Erasmus internship at the Donders Institute and the Behavioural Neurogenetics group of Prof. Dr. Judith Homberg, I enrolled in the Cognitive Neuroscience Master’s program at Radboud University. I soon joined the CAN-Lab for my Thesis project under the supervision of Dr. Florian Krause and Dr. Erno Hermans. After the completion of my Thesis I was able to continue working on various projects in the group as a Research Assistant / Lab Manager.</p>

<p> In my personal time I like discovering new tasty recipes and experimenting with them in my kitchen. I also like playing board- and videogames, while enjoying bitter IPA beers.</p>
